Simple Note-Taking API implemented using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as the database. The API provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing text notes. Here's a summary of key components and features:

Technology Stack:

Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Functionality:

Create Note: Endpoint (POST /api/notes) to add a new note to the database.
Retrieve Notes: Endpoint (GET /api/notes) to get a list of all notes.
Retrieve Single Note: Endpoint (GET /api/notes/:id) to retrieve a single note by its ID.
Update Note: Endpoint (PUT /api/notes/:id) to update the content of an existing note.
Delete Note: Endpoint (DELETE /api/notes/:id) to delete a note from the database.
Data Model:

Each note has a title, content, and timestamps for creation and last modification.
Features:

Data Validation: Implemented validation for note creation and updating, ensuring that the title and content fields are provided and of appropriate lengths.
Error Handling: Developed comprehensive error handling for the API, covering scenarios like invalid input and attempts to access or modify non-existent notes.
Basic Authentication (Optional): Added a simple authentication mechanism (like Basic Auth) to protect the endpoints (optional, based on time constraints).
Documentation: Documented the API endpoints, including details about request methods, URL paths, expected request body format, and response formats.
Testing: Basic tests have been written to ensure API endpoints are functioning as expected.
Project Structure:

This project has  a server folder containing Node modules and code.
The .gitignore file in the root folder excludes unnecessary files and directories from version control.
Overall, this  project provides a robust backend for a note-taking application, ensuring data integrity, security, and ease of use.
